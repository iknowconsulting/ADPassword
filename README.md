ADPassword
======================

A Zimbra server extension to change Active Directory passwords from the Zimbra web client.


The original project by Antonio Messina (a.messina@iknowconsulting.it) https://github.com/xMAnton/ADPassword currently tested on Zimbra 8.6 and Windows 2012 R2 Active Directory.

The below steps are also in a how-to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYmsdw3tHoU

## Installation

- As root, create the /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/adpassword directory
- As root, copy adPassword.jar into /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/adpassword/

## Add the certificate from your Active Directory to the Zimbra server trust
* /opt/zimbra/j2sdk-20140721/bin/keytool -import -alias cacertclass1ca -keystore /opt/zimbra/java/jre/lib/security/cacerts -import -trustcacerts -file your-exported-cert.cer 
* default password: changeit
* keytool binary may be on a different location if you are not running 8.6
* zmcontrol restart (after adding the certificate)

## Configure authentication settings for your domain

- Open the Zimbra Administration console
- Select External LDAP as authentication mechanism
- Type the LDAP URL and check Use SSL on port 636 (your certificate must be trusted, see below)
- Type `(samaccountname=%u)` in the LDAP filter field
- Specify `CN=Users, DC=DOMAIN, DC=EXT` in the LDAP search base field
- Check "Use DN/Password to bind to external server"
- Enter the Bind DN `CN=Administrator,CN=Users, DC=DOMAIN,DC=EXT` and its password
- If Test passed succesfully, click Finish
- Assign the new External change password listener: `ADPassword`
- From the cli run as Zimbra user:

         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraAuthLdapSearchBindDn "CN=Administrator,CN=Users, DC=DOMAIN,DC=EXT"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraAuthLdapSearchBindPassword "admin-password-here"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraAuthLdapBindDn "%u@domain.ext"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraAuthLdapURL "ldaps://ad-server-ip-or-dnsname:636" 
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraAuthLdapSearchBase "CN=Users, DC=DOMAIN, DC=EXT"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraAuthLdapSearchFilter "(samaccountname=%u)"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraExternalGroupLdapSearchBase "CN=Users, DC=DOMAIN, DC=EXT"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraExternalGroupLdapSearchFilter "(samaccountname=%u)"
         zmprov md domain.ext zimbraPasswordChangeListener ADPassword
         zmcontrol restart
